Normally I edit .abc files in emacs which works great. But I often
miss a powerfull, yet simple way to handle the .abc files I have lying
around on my harddisk. abctool is intended as a "one stop script" for
manipulating (transposing, viewing, translation to danish chords)
finished .abc files.

It's also intended as a platform for me to re-implement some of the
algorithms I wrote in php (esp. a correct transposing algorithm) in a
more generally useful format.

Finally it was a way for me to get to know python.
