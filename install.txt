Since abctool is a python script, it doesn't need to be installed. How
ever, it depends on a number of things to be present on the system to
perform it's various tasks:

* Python
* abcm2ps (to generate postscript files)
* gv (to view postscript files, and to generate pdf files )
* abc2midi (to convert to midi or listen to a file)
* timidity (to listen to a file)
* texexec (to use the --songbook feature), in debian it's part of the
  tetex-extra package
* abc2abc (to transpose using -T, not recommended)
